                      HWGUI - Harbour Win32 GUI library

   1) Windows

   Installation procedure is very simple.

   There are few bat files to build HwGUI with C compiler of your choice:

   make_b32.bat  - Borland C
   make_pc.bat   - Pelles C
   make_vc.bat   - Microsoft Visual C
   make_w32.bat  - Open Watcom C
   makemngw.bat  - Mingw

   You need to set the environment variable HB_PATH, which must contain a path
   to your Harbour directory. This can be done in your Windows environment or
   by adding a line to appropriate bat file:

      SET HB_PATH=c:\harbour

   Then run the selected bat file and you'll get hwgui.lib, procmisc.lib,
   hbxml.lib  and qhtm.lib in lib/ directory.

   With Harbour you can also build libraries, using Hbmk2 utility, just write:

      hbmk2 hwgui.hbp procmisc.hbp hbxml.hbp hbactivex.hbp hwg_contrib.hbp hwgdebug.hbp

   You may omit hbactivex.hbp, hwg_contrib.hbp and hwgdebug.hbp, if you 
   don't need these libraries.

       To build samples you need to run appropriate .bat files, fixing environment
   variables there.
       For Dbc you should have rddads.lib and ace32.lib ( by default - in 
   harbour/lib/ directory.
       Bld.bat should be executed with prg file name as a parameter:

   bld a

   2) Linux

   	Sources for the Linux GTK version are located in the gtk/ directory. 
   There is a shell file build.sh, which is intended for building HwGUI Linux 
   libraries. The environment variable HB_ROOT is set there, based on the 
   assumption, that HwGUI directory is within the Harbour directory. If no,
   you need to write the correct path to your Harbour directory, for example:

      export HB_ROOT=/home/me/harbour

        Then just run the build.sh and four libraries must appear in the gtk/lib:

      libhbxml.a
      libhwgui.a
      libhwgdebug.a
      libprocmisc.a

   You will find few samples in gtk/samples directory and a shell file build.sh.
   The environment variable HB_ROOT is set there, based on the assumption, that
   HwGUI directory is within the Harbour directory. If no, you need to write the
   correct path to your Harbour directory.
