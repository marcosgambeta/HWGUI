[*] Changes


HWGUI 2.16 ( 14.09.2006 )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[+] Native Win32 Toolbar, extended Grid control (HGridEX) has been added.

[*] GTK's HBrowse, HPanel and HOwnButton synchronized with Win32 version.

[!] Three class variables in HBrowse has been renamed for better readability:
       kolz  --> nRecords
       tekzp --> nCurrent
       msrec --> aArray
    so you need to make search and replace in your programs to rename them.

[*] Many bug fixes and enhancements in both GTK and Win32 versions - 
    see Changelog for details.

HWGUI 2.15 ( 07.06.2006 )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[+] Linux GTK version of HwGUI has been implemented. It haven't yet all
    functionality of the Windows version, but most of the main subsystems
    ( GET system, browse, printing, ... ) are ready to use.

[+] Some new classes has been added, including HWinPrn.
    New functions has been added. See Changelog for the details.

[!] Many bug fixes and enhancements - see Changelog for details.

HWGUI 2.14 ( 14.12.2004 )
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[*] An important Designer enhancement - it can be used to build reports.
    Now it is the main HwGUI Report Builder instead of HWReport.
    New classes are added - HRepItem,HRepTmpl, which provides printing
    using the reports, created with the Designer.

[+] OpenImage( cFileName,lString ) function has been added - it reads some
      picture files ( jpeg, gif ) and converts them to the HBitmap structure,
      so the HBitmap():AddFile( cFileName ) can load now jpeg and gif files,
      @ x,y BITMAP command now works with jpeg and gif, too.

[*] Important HPrinter enhancements:
    - New parameter added to the HPrinter():New() method - lmm - if it is TRUE,
      all subsequent printer operations accept coordinates as millimeters ;
    - New commands has been added:
       INIT PRINTER <oPrinter> [ NAME <cPrinter> ] [ <lPixel: PIXEL> ]
       INIT DEFAULT PRINTER <oPrinter> [ <lPixel: PIXEL> ]
      By default ( if the PIXEL clause isn't used, all subsequent printer
      operations accept coordinates as millimeters ;
    - New method for HPrinter has been implemented - SetMode( nOrientation )
      to change the orientation:
         portrait(nOrientation==1) / landscape(nOrientation==2) ;
    - New variable nPage and automatic handling of pages numbers has been added ;
    - HPrinter():Preview() method and related functions are extended:
      Zoom buttons, trackbars for preview image repositioning has been added.
      New parameters added - optional arrays for button's bmps and tooltips.

[*] Richedit related code is changed to support the Richedit 2.0.

[*] HTrackbar is modified to allow user defined sliders.

[*] Internal messages processing has been changed. Now the callback *WndProc
    functions calls onEvent() method instead of appropriate Def* function.
    This allow to subclass window, dialog and control classes and, defining new
    onEvent() methods for them, to change the default messages processing.
    The HWindow() class is now a parent class for HMainWindow(), HMDIChildWindow()
    and HChildWIndow() classes.
